==========

Handle CSV files using table models and queries.

### TODO
* Add support for virtual fields (that calculate node degrees based on other fields for example)
* Allow data to be easily moved from one Table (or other similar data structure) from another easily. This could be done with export and import methods.
* Add support for adding rows through a manager
* Add unit tests
* Have a method that evaluates virtual fields based on a given query
